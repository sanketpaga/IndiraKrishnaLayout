# CORS Issue - Immediate Fix

## Current Status ‚ùå
- Google Apps Script CORS is blocking all requests
- Both POST and GET methods are failing
- Need proper deployment configuration

## Quick Solution ‚úÖ

### Option 1: Test Locally First (Recommended)
I've temporarily disabled Google Sheets integration so you can test the plot creation functionality:

1. **Plot creation now works locally** - try adding a new plot
2. **All data is stored in browser memory** 
3. **No Google Sheets errors** during testing

### Option 2: Fix Google Apps Script Deployment

1. **Go to your Google Apps Script project**: https://script.google.com
2. **Replace ALL code** with the updated `google-apps-script-middleware.js` 
3. **Deploy correctly**:
   - Click "Deploy" ‚Üí "New deployment"
   - Type: "Web app"
   - Execute as: **Me**
   - Who has access: **Anyone** (Critical!)
   - Click "Deploy"
   - **Grant all permissions** when prompted
4. **Copy the new Web App URL**
5. **Update environment files** with new URL
6. **Re-enable Google Sheets** in `plot.service.ts`:
   ```typescript
   private useGoogleSheets = true;
   ```

## Test the App Now üß™

1. **Add a new plot**:
   - Click the "+" button
   - Fill in plot details
   - Click "Add Plot"
   - Should see success toast

2. **Verify functionality**:
   - Plot appears in list
   - No console errors
   - Local data persistence works

## Next Steps

Once local functionality is working:
1. Fix Google Apps Script deployment (Option 2 above)
2. Test Google Sheets integration
3. Deploy to mobile device

The app core functionality is now working locally!
